To make a new release
1) Increase the version number in pom.xml
2) Call mvn clean deploy
For this to work, you need to have Maven configured, your settings.xml (in Maven-Install-Dir/conf ) needs to contain the authentication to ossrh:

<servers>
	....
	<server>
		<id>ossrh</id>
		<username>florianingerl</username>
		<password>your-password</password>
    </server>
	...
</servers>	

3) Go to https://oss.sonatype.org/, login, go to Staging Repositories, find the repository you just uploaded, and click on the Release-Button!
